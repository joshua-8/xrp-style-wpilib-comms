# xrp-style-wpilib-comms

# work in progress

This library is not officially associated with XRP or wpilib, but it builds on their excellent work.

The goal is for this library to be compatible with the protocol meant for XRP robots running the [xrp-wpilib-firmware](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/xrp-wpilib-firmware). 

This library uses the standard Arduino WiFi and UDP library.
