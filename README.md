# xrp-style-wpilib-comms

# work in progress

This library is not officially associated with xrp or wpilib. 

The goal is for this library to be compatible with the protocol meant for XRP robots running the [xrp-wpilib-firmware](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/xrp-wpilib-firmware). 

This library uses the standard Arduino WiFi and UDP library.

* Raspberry Pi Pico 1W - untested
* Raspberry Pi Pico 2W - untested
* ESP32 devboard (Alfredo Systems NoU2) - untested
* ESP32-S3 QT Py (RCM BYTE and RCM Nibble) - untested
* Alfredo Systems NoU3 - untested
