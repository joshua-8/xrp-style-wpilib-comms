# xrp-style-wpilib-comms

# work in progress

This library is not officially associated with xrp or wpilib. The goal is for this library to be compatible with the protocol meant for XRP robots running the [xrp-wpilib-firmware](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/xrp-wpilib-firmware). This library is tested on Raspberry Pi 1W, Raspberry Pi 2W, ESP32 devkit, and ESP32-S3 QT Py. It uses the standard Arduino WiFi and UDP library.
